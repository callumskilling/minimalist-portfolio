# Minimalist Portfolio

This is a solution to the [Minimalist portfolio website challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/minimalist-portfolio-website-LMy-ZRyiE). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Click the "About Me" call-to-action on the homepage and have the screen scroll down to the next section
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Message` fields are empty should show "This field is required"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"

## Installation

Install the project with npm. The project was created using Create React App, a now deprecated project. I suggest using [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/) for future React projects.

```bash
  npm install
  npm run start
```
